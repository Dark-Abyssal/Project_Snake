Movement for game = 
'up'- key(up)
'down'- key(down)
'left'- key(left)
'right'- key(right)

Goal of the game is to have the 'snake' eat the object and have it grow longer while avoiding the walls and it's body. 
Attempt to make it as long as possible!
Once the snake reaches a certain length, going in the opposite direction of where the snake is heading eg.(when going left, pressed right), will result in game over due to snake eating itself.

Control option in Menu explains this as well, including some additional instructions
